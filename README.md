# Group Capstone Project aka A Day of Adventure
This project represents the group capstone project I participated in at Coding Dojo. This specific repositiory has been cloned from the original so that I can contine to update it on my own. This project was completed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I was responsible for the creating the routes, the comment feature, and the bcrypt feature. I acted as the manager of the GitHub repository which entailed setting up the repository and it's rules, reviewing code before approving pull request, merging the code and reviewing any conflicts, and reminding the team to do pulls and rebases for their working branches. 

The website was designed as a social media site where users can post about their daily adventures. It allows users to upload a picture to go with their post, to edit their posts, to view the posts of other, and to make comments. The site features user registration and login.
